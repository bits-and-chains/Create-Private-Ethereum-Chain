### There are three types of blockchains, _public_, _private_, and _consortium_.

### The public blockchain is completely decentralized and open to all nodes. Most well known example is the bitcoin blockchain.

### Consortium blockchains are blockchains where a pre-selected group of nodes are selected. The [R3](http://www.r3cev.com/) is an example of a consortium blockchain.

### A private blockchain only has one organization that controls the node. Private blockchain acts very much like a traditional database, only it is immutable
